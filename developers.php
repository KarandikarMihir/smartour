                <p style="text-align:justify;">Mihir is from Pune. Mihir grew up obsessing over video games and computers. He is very reserved to himself. Some of Mihir's fondest memories are listening to music with his mother, working with his father in his advertising agency. When SmarTour presented itself, he knew he was helping to build something special and true to his heart. Outside of computers Mihir enjoys Psychedelic and Progressive Rock Music, being a crazy cat person and debating the current affairs in the nation with his family.</p>

He has won many prizes in the dance competitions. He occasionally draws and paints. One of his best qualities is PR. When Jitesh isn't working on SmarTour, you can easily find him with one of his friend circles or spending time with his family and passing along his love of automobiles, dance, video games, animated movies and what not to his friends.</p>
